Ever want to write fast image filtering code but don't know how?
I am going to help you get started with C99. Once we are done,
you can write your own image filters and only worry about the
RGBA byte arrays (pixels) and not all of the other details.

Because we are writing it in C99 , it will be BLAZINGLY FAST!

We will write a little bit of code every video.
